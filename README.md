### EXP Discord Bots

EXP is a video game clan which has a community discord server with over **11,000 members** with a suite of bots that I coded.

Across the bots, there are lots of features that the members can take advantage of:
- The main feature is the bank: members can donate their in-game gems to the clan, and receive balance within the discord server upon which they can gain interest, and gift gems to other members. The bank holds trillions of gems.
- Another feature is a robust giveaway system. There are 4 different types of giveaways that run multiple times a day, resulting in 1000s of dollars worth of in-game items given away per month. A new feature allows the users to host giveaways themselves with over **300B gems** given away so far.
- There is a moderation system the admins can use in order to keep the peace within the discord server. This allows the moderation actions to be logged and viewed which makes for a better organized server.
- For each user feature, there are admin commands to allow the admins to manage everything.

The bots are hosted on a VPS with a **custom CI/CD solution** which allows for rapid auto deployments and minimal down time.

They're coded with Typescript on the bun runtime, and the server uses elysia, and a turso database.
