    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold max-md:text-2xl">From Scratch</h1>
    <p class="mt-4">In Progress</p>
    <p class="mt-4">A series of projects I created to learn fundamentals across software engineering as well as solidify my typescript and rust programming skills.</p>
    <p class="mt-2">Projects include a blockchain, a neural network, physics simulation, encryption and more implementations from scratch.</p>
    <!-- - learned fundamentals
    - solidified ts/rust/programming
    - show notes that I've taken (machine learning, blockchain, cybersec algos, etc)
